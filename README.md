## Introduction

Our research delves into the intricate relationship between lifestyle elements and an individual's family income-to-poverty ratio in the United States from 2017 to 2018. The study focuses on lifestyle predictors such as alcohol consumption, hours slept, BMI, marital status, and smoking habits, aiming to provide valuable insights for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and individuals. By quantifying the impact of these variables, we contribute to informed decision-making and societal progress.

## Methods

We utilized data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for individuals aged 30 or older. After preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding variables, we constructed a multiple linear regression (MLR) model to analyze the relationships between lifestyle factors and income-to-poverty ratio. Model diagnostics and selection were performed to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Results

The final MLR model revealed significant associations between lifestyle factors and income-to-poverty ratio. Being married, higher sleep hours, and lower BMI were positively correlated with income, while alcohol consumption and smoking had negative associations. Model comparison highlighted the efficacy of the transformed model, addressing non-normality and ensuring robustness.

## Discussion

The findings align with existing literature, emphasizing the complex interplay of socioeconomic factors. While some issues persist, such as non-significance of certain predictors, the comprehensive analysis contributes to a nuanced understanding of income dynamics. Ethical considerations guided data handling and model selection, ensuring transparency and accountability.

## Conclusion

Our study provides valuable insights into the relationship between lifestyle factors and income-to-poverty ratio, underscoring the importance of holistic approaches to socioeconomic analysis. Despite lingering issues, the findings contribute to informed decision-making and highlight the need for continued research in this area.
